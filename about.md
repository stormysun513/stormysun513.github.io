I have always been working on building impactful products and solving real
world challenges.

As a software engineering graduate student from Carnegie Mellon, I care about
how to build a maintainable and efficient programs and strive for developing
usable and robust software product for customers.

I have more than one year experience in IoT product development, which covered
software on both development boards, android, and web application. Our product
is actively integrated into rehabilitation treatment. This work was accepted
in ACM UbiComp 2015 and ACM CHI 2016.
