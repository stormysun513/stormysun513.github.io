  			  <h3>Autonomous Driving Vehicle Control Simulation</h3>
        </a>
  			<p>
         The objective of this project is to design a hierarchical statechart
         for an autonomous driving vehicle to respond to environment events
         as if there is a human operator sitting in the driverâ€™s seat. Simulink
         and Stateflow are used to validate the architecture design.

  			  <h3>Android Data Preparation Framework using Bezirk</h3>
        </a>
  			<p>
         Software engineering practicum project in Bezirk. The goal is to design
         and develop an Android data preparation framework on top of the Bezirk
         middleware. It must facilitate data scientists to configure, insert,
         and remove individual data processing units used for identifying user
         preferences and interests.

  			  <h3>Mobile Application - EasyOrder</h3>
        </a>
  			<p>
         The goal of this project is to explore different features between two
         common mobile platform: Android and iOS. I developed a cross-platform
         meal ordering application, allowing users to order meals, keep track of
         the real-time location updates of delivery drivers, and complete
         payments in a single application

  			  <h3>ParGMRES - A Parallel Linear Solver</h3>
        </a>
  			<p>
        The goal of project is to explore parallel techniques we learned in
        the class. We implemented our own general minimal residual algorithm
        and parallelized it using both OpenMP and CUDA. GMRES is an iterative
        method to solve linear system Ax = b. Due to its iterative fashion,
        the algorithm is inherently sequential. What we focus is to parallelize
        those matrix operations.

  			<h3>Image Classification Using Labeled and Unlabeled Data</h3>
  			<p>
        This project is to improve performance of image classification using
        unlabeled image data. The dataset is cifar-10 with 5000 labeled images,
        45000 unlabeled images,  and 10000 images for testing. I tried two methods
        to solve this problem. The first one is to use Kmeans with spatial pyramid
        matching while the second one use CNN with self-training approach.

  			<p>
        A website that collects recipes from different websites and estimates
        prices required to make them. Our web server is developed using Django
        framework with PostgreSQL. Users are able to register an account, comments,
        and search recipes. Data are crawled using Selenium and python
        BeautifulSoup library.

  			<h3>Realtime Resource Reservation Framework</h3>
  			<p>
        We built an energy-aware resource reservation framework in Linux
        kernel. Users are able to specify timing constraints of tasks and
        their corresponding periods. The system will then schedule these
        tasks based on these constraints while still running other tasks
        maintained by Linux OS at the same time. We also made a android
        application able to log framework configuration and status of
        these tasks using android NDK.

  			<h3>Deep Learning in Speech Recognition</h3>
        <p>
        The project is to build a speech recognition system predicting English
        sentences from speech data using deep learning techniques. A speech
        recognition system comprises of two parts: acoustic feature
        transformation and the language construction. We used a deep neural
        network and structured SVM for acoustic part and used recurrent neural
        network to rescore the possible output generated by the WFST algorithm.

  			<h3>Functionally Reduced And-Inverter Gates Simulator</h3>
        <p>
        An optimization tool that reads a circuit represented in an acyclic
        graph and remove redundant subgraphs. We are asked to manage memory
        allocation of these components in the graph by overriding the new and
        delete operation in C++. Graph traversal approach like BFS and DFS
        are used to find unreachable gates and propagate simulation results.
        Explicit free lists are used to chain available memories for management.
